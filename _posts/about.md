## Our Journey

I was born in 2016. I have a very big family. I have an adorable little puppy that is a sausage dog. I am the biggest <a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/" target="_blank">“swiftie”</a> ever. I love reading, writing and drawing. My favourite things are Taylor Swift, puppies, pizza, ice cream, lollies and lasagne. I love to watch TV. I like to play with my puppy, my brother and last but not least my friends.  

It all started when I was 7, when me and my dad went to have some pizza and I asked if kids were allowed to have a business and my dad said yes. What I love about having a business is that  it is fun and I like the way you can sell anything which is why I chose the combination that I have. ( Books, Jewellery and Fidgets ) I like getting the money and I like having something interesting to do. I also like doing the selling at the markets. 

I wanted to be an author after I made my first book called [“all about dexter”](${basePath}/posts/books) to surprise my mum and dad. It was exciting to make my first book so, I wanted to make some more books.
