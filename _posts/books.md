## My First children's Book  

I got the idea to make books from my dad when we were on holiday. He asked me if there was anything else I wanted to sell but I could not think of anything so he gave me some ideas and one of them was books. I like to draw and write so I decided to make one. 

My first book was called **“all about dexter“**. I did all the words and the illustrations myself. This is it. 


Unfortunately this is the only copy and I was not able to sell this one. This was when I decided to make and publish my first real kids book on Amazon.  

## My second children's Book  

My second book that I am planing on publishing and selling as a hard cover is called **“Everyone Likes to Rhyme“** and it’s about 4 kids who like to rhyme. I have don all the planning, writing and illustrations for this book. I have also helped with the design.

It is **coming soon** to an Amazon near you.
