## My First children's Book  

I got the idea to make books from my dad when we were on holiday. He asked me if there was anything else I wanted to sell but I could not think of anything so he gave me some ideas and one of them was books. I like to draw and write so I decided to make one. 

My first book was called **“all about dexter“**. I did all the words and the illustrations myself. This is it. 

<table class="min-w-full text-left text-sm font-light text-surface dark:text-white">
  <thead class="border-b border-neutral-200 font-medium dark:border-white/10">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="px-6 py-4">Cover</th>
      <th scope="col" class="px-6 py-4">Page 1</th>
      <th scope="col" class="px-6 py-4">Page 2</th>
      <th scope="col" class="px-6 py-4">Page </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="border-b border-neutral-200 dark:border-white/10">
      <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4"><img src="${basePath}/assets/blog/books/AllAboutDexter-cover.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Cover"/></td>
      <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4"><img src="${basePath}/assets/blog/books/AllAboutDexter-page1.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Page 1"/></td>
      <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4"><img src="${basePath}/assets/blog/books/AllAboutDexter-page2.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Page 2"/></td>
      <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4"><img src="${basePath}/assets/blog/books/AllAboutDexter-page3.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Page 3"/></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Unfortunately this is the only copy and I was not able to sell this one. This was when I decided to make and publish my first real kids book on Amazon.  

## My second children's Book  

My second book that I am planing on publishing and selling as a hard cover is called **“Everyone Likes to Rhyme“** and it’s about 4 kids who like to rhyme. I have don all the planning, writing and illustrations for this book. I have also helped with the design.

It is **coming soon** to an Amazon near you.
